# Git & GitHub Tutorial
## IEEE SusTech Branch - Project Team - Practice repo 💙 

Hello, my name is Ibrahim and welcome to this practice repo 👋

Your first task is a simple one, just clone this repo and open a pull request to push a modified version of this ReadMe.md

The modification you perform itself will also be very simple:

**1. Append a quote of your choice (can even be made-up) within quotations, followed by a tilde and the quote's author**

**2. Append your name in brackets following that text**

Like so,

"I like macaroni and cheese" ~ Someone Somewhere (Ibrahim Adil)

Best of luck everyone! 😄

"نحن هدفتا.....ما عندنا اي هدف"  ~ wise sayings (Abdalla yousif)

"stay strong for yourself" (samar omer)

"friends dont lie"11(Remaz Ahmed)

### Well done everyone who submitted a quote for the first task! :smiley: :+1:

Now, onto the second task. This task's goals are threefold;

**1. Pushing and committing to a repo that is entirely your own**

You should create a repository (preferrably public), and add something to it.

**2. Adding collaborators to work with you, on your own repo**

You should add me as a collaborator on your repo

**3. Creating branches within a repo**

You should create another branch on your repo, in which I will add some changes to the contents you pushed. You will then proceed to merge the two branches

Once again, best of luck everybody! 😄
