# Git & GitHub Tutorial
## IEEE SusTech Branch - Project Team - Practice repo 💙 

Hello, my name is Ibrahim and welcome to this practice repo 👋

Your first task is a simple one, just clone this repo and open a pull request to push a modified version of this ReadMe.md

The modification you perform itself will also be very simple:

**1. Append a quote of your choice (can even be made-up) within quotations, followed by a tilde and the quote's author**

**2. Append your name in brackets following that text**

Like so,

"I like macaroni and cheese" ~ Someone Somewhere (Ibrahim Adil)

Best of luck everyone! 😄
